# Blogging-First-Project

This project is my initial foray into the world of blogging platforms, focusing on creating a comprehensive blogging system. It is designed using React for the frontend and incorporates various components such as headers, footers, and more, to offer a rich user experience.

- npm (Comes with Node.js installation)

You can verify the installation by running:
